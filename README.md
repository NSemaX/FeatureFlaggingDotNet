Factory Design Pattern with Dependency Injection - Feature Flagging - Analog Devices GUI Team - Mini Hackathon-1

# Factory Design Pattern
Abstracts the object creation process. Allows subclasses to create objects. The subclasses themselves determine which class object will be created in run-time.

# Dependency Injection
It provides a loosely coupled relationship between two tightly coupled objects. 
The object to be used in different classes is created only once and that the needed classes are injected externally when needed.

# Feature Flagging
Powerful feature flagging and A/B testing for C# apps using [GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io/)
